 *
 * The Input Events library allows applications to receive and process events
 * from input devices. The classes of events that are recognized by the
 * Input Events library are:
 * - TOUCH (@c INPUT_CLASS_MTOUCH)
 * - KEYBOARD (@c INPUT_CLASS_KEYBOARD)
 * - MOUSE (@c INPUT_CLASS_MOUSE)

 * @brief Enumerations and structures for input events
 *
 * The event_types.h header file provides type definitions for classifying
 * input event types.  These type definitions can be used to determine the kind
 * of input event that has occurred and the properties of the event.
