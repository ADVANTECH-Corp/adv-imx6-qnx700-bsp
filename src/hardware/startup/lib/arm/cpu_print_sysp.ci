//
// NOTE: This file is shared between pidin and the startup library.
// Ordinarily, we'd put it in a library that both code references, but
// that would complicate building startups in a manner that we don't
// want. Instead, a copy of this file is placed in both locations
// and a distinct print_sysp.h file in both directories provide the
// 'glue' to hook up this code with the particularities of the environment.
// If you make any changes to this file, you should also copy the new
// version to the other location (after first checking that no-one's
// modified the other copy and forgotten to update this location).
// Normally this won't be a problem since the file will only change in
// response to system page layout changes and the copy in startup will
// be modified first and then copied to the pidin tree.
//
// This file is in:
//utils/p/pidin/arm_print_sysp.ci & hardware/startup/lib/arm/cpu_print_sysp.ci
