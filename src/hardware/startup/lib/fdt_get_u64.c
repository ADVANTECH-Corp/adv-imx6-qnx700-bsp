 * Extracts a 64-bit value from a property.

 * bigger than 64 bits, this paramater can be used to access the next 64-bit
 * word of that value, by feeding the function the result of a previous call.
 * @param	fdt		Device tree
 * @param	node	Node ID
 * @paran	offset	Number of bytes into the value to look at
 * @param	name	Property name
 * @param	pp		Holds the value, upon successful return
 * @return	0 if successful and the value is 64-bit wide
 * 			>0 if successful and the value is more than 64-bits wide, in which
 * 			   case the result can be used as the offset in a subsequent call
 * 			<0 on error
